# ci_mentor_insights

This is an attempt to provide more standardized readme examples for students for each milestone project. 

The hope is to provide a more standard writeup to lead students to success and make assessments easier to conduct and less reliant on an assessor's ability to dig into code and hunt and peck for specific assessment criteria.

## Project Specific Readme Templates

## Helpful Templates

I've also added links to helpful google templates that I created for myself when going through the course. I reference the following in at least one of the readme templates: 

- [Manual Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189VpSeEG9oevSRhvb2WZl8zCk9L3s2iWQyrJ_1jjAGQ/edit?usp=sharing) 
- [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing)


## Helpful tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
