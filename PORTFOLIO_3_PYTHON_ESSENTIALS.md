# OVERVIEW

This template was made as a guide to ensure you cover assessment criteria in your third milestone write up. It is specific to the **PORTFOLIO 3: Python Essentials** project. It was based off the [battleship readme](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/CSSEssentials/p3-readme.png) with a few additions to help elevate you to possible distinction status.


Sections marked as 🚨**Required**  and 🚀 **merit & beyond**

**Please note** that project assessment criteria changes more often than these guides are updated so double-check the submission criteria before assuming the  🚨**Required**  is all you have to do to pass.

## Helpful tools

### Debugging Your run.py in gitpod
With a single file importing others, gitpod lets you set breakpoints where you then can look at variables and try out syntax.

### Screenshots and Videos
**Here’s a great video on how to add videos to your readme! no need to convert to gifs!!**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Cytlicv8Y

> 1. record a video via slack
> 2. download it
> 3. in github, edit your readme via the pencil icon
> 4. type a place holder word and highlight it
> 5. drag and drop mp4 file over that text
> 6. scroll down to the commit area
> 7. update the default commit message
> 8. click the green button
> 9. ```git pull``` changes to your gitpod workspace

**You can do the steps 3-9 for the image/screenshot uploads too!**

### Cheatsheets and Auto Generation Tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
🚀 **merit & beyond**

Copy your readme to https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

====================================== The Sections you Fill in are below ==============================

# PROJECT NAME
🚨**Required** 
*replace the **PROJECT NAME** header with your project's name*
- Include a screenshot or gif of your terminal running in heroku
- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
- Write this as a sales pitch or commercial to entice users to interact with your site or how you want investors to purchase your website.

**To create a gif**:
1. take a video of your program using slack in a message to yourself
2. download the video
3. upload it to https://convertio.co/mp4-gif/
4. download the gif
5. copy the file and paste it into your readme like you do with screenshots

## Live Site
🚨**Required** 

- Include a link to deployed project (typically a herokuapp url )

## Repository
🚨**Required** 

- Include a Link to the GitHub repository
## Author
🚨**Required** 

DEVELOPER_NAME (take credit for the work you do!)

## Table of Contents
🚀 **merit & beyond**

Generate after readme is complete by copying and pasting your readme from this point & below into this tool:
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/)
**NOTE:** It does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers

## How To Play/Use
🚨**Required** 

Paragraph or bullet points of how the user initiates the program and interfaces with it. You could have videos of each bit if you want and direct what the user should do.

you can have a gif here too if you want.

## Features
🚨**Required** 

Use this section to itemize the features of your project. 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into piece parts or core functionality blocks such as data upload, user input, analysis and data output; focusing on the atomic functions and data model(s) or classes you created to make the program work. 


### Implemented Features
🚨**Required** 

In each subsection, write out what the feature is for and what value it adds. If there is terminal interaction or output associated with the function, include a screenshot/gif.


### Future Features
🚀 **merit & beyond**

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.


## Flow Chart
🚀 **merit & beyond**

This section is where you would share logic diagrams and spreadsheets that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. 

The flowchart can be as simple as a picture of a drawing of how you envisioned laying out the logic for you project, or done with a professional tool such as powerpoint, googlesheets, or [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/) They are a roadmap and do not have to be 100% accurate of the final product.

## Data Model/ Classes
🚨**Required** 

In this section write our your data model(s) or classes. 

You might want to include subsections that include how the data in the model is initialized and then the methods that you created to update it through the program.


You can create a table and take a screenshot, or you can write up subsections in markdown:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/130148204-b56406bf-0fff-48f3-9dee-2f3cdbe67cc5.png)

### Class X
To better group the game as an object, I wrote a class representing its properties and had method functions to update those properties: 

**Properties**
- property 1: is a {string} it represents {something} 
- property 2: is a {string} it represents {something} 

**Methods**
- **\_\_init\_\_**: Initialize method, it starts the class off with default parameters as if a user just started to play a game.
- **\_\_str\_\_**: Returns a string representation of the class/object

## Libraries used
🚀 **merit & beyond**

List out the python libraries you purposefully used in your project and why. You can look at your requirements.txt file and go back to https://pypi.org/ to rediscover the purpose of a library if needed.

A bulleted list is a good presentation for this information.

## Testing
🚨**Required** 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your features and ensure that they all work as intended in an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


### Validation Testing
🚨**Required** 

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, paste it into [CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and take a screenshot of the linter output showing NO ERRORS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 

adding
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

### Manual Testing
🚨**Required** 

Use Markdown to track how you tested each bit of user input for each valid option, various invalid entries and leading/trailing spaces

**Feature 1**
- [ ] invalid entry, says sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] no entry, says sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] alpha when numeric expected, sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] valid entry with leading spaces, trimmed and shows proper next stage
- [ ] valid entry with trailing spaces, trimmed and shows proper next stage

You should also call out how you tested any other features such as:
- Welcome Message, recaps username
- Score update shows current score
- color change for correct vs incorrect
- google sheet updated properly

If you prefer spreadsheets, create a google-sheet and link to it in this section, just make sure you update the permissions to allow anyone to view it. You can make a [COPY of this example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_JUmFfzHVtXdHse6ib82BGnRMPlPqufSOnAVN3bVl8/edit?usp=sharing) and update it as your own. Just make sure you share it to anyone with the link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_JUmFfzHVtXdHse6ib82BGnRMPlPqufSOnAVN3bVl8/edit?usp=sharing

### Defect Tracking
🚨**Required** 

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.

 Here's a [guide to GitHub Defects](Defects.md)

### Defects of Note
🚀 **merit & beyond**

Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and link to them directly here.


### Outstanding Defects
🚨**Required** 

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impact a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try
- there is an open issue against a framework, browser or technology used

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline it's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live: "Yes it looks odd, but it doesn't impact core functionality of the site." than to let the accessors think you didn't notice it. 

### Commenting Code
🚀 **merit & beyond**

Make sure you use triple double quotes to document functions and classes.
 Here'a  documentation worthy example:
```$python
def yes_no(question):
    """
    Function to ask a simple yes no question of the user.
    :param question: String displayed as the question
    :return: answer: String equal to "1" or "2" representing yes or no respectfully
    """
    print(question)
    print("yes = 1")
    print("no = 2")
    answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    while answer not in ("1", "2"):
        print("please choose 1 for yes and 2 for no")
        answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    return answer

```

## Deployment
🚨**Required** 

### Requirements
🚨**Required** 

If the user is required to have certain keys and credentials you should include this section with directions on how to get the necessary information.
ex)
1. **Google Account:** In order to have this program work, you need a google account. If you don't have one  [Create a google account](https://accounts.google.com/Signup)
2. **Google APIs**
    1. in a new incognito tab, log into your new google account.
    1. then update the url to be: https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?pli=1 
        
        **GOOGLE DRIVE API Access**
        1.  create a new project for this, call it XXXXXX (You might want to refer to what you see in this video: https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/071036790a5642f9a6f004f9888b6a45/ at the bottom of the screen to write out steps.)

        1. click the Libray  Tab and serarch for Google Sheets
        2. click enable

3. The downloaded credentialsJSON file is basically your creds.json file that you need to put into your heroku settings or gitpod environment to access your google drive.

4. Google Sheet Template
  - If you had to create specific sheets for your project, instruct users to make their own copy of it from yours and rename it back to what the python project expects
  - And don't forget to share the spreadsheet in question with the client_email from the creds.json 

### Gitpod
🚀 **merit & beyond**

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_email": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accoutns.google.com/0/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cer_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Heroku
🚨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to Heroku. Include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

You may want to re-watch the [python essentials deployment video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/e3b664e16366444c8d722c5d8340b340/?child=first) when writing up this section.


If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values.
Do not share your personal keys but either cut them out of the screen shot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such values.

1. Fork the repository

Make a fork so you have a copy of the repository in your own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132136504-eb79a6f3-0205-4c82-80c2-eef136ec7e4c.png)


2.  New Project
Log into Heroku and create a new project. Name it something like XXX_coders_bistro.


3.  Settings
On the settings tab you have to address two things:
A. **Config Vars**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135869-215d2e0f-805d-40a8-a8c2-fb1098e2645d.png)

  At a bar minimum you should show the user that they need to add the PORT. 8000 key value pair.


B. **Build Packs**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135918-28cac112-7766-4277-905c-4a4963d8442d.png)

  add Python Then Node.js


4. Deploy
A. Set up to github and select the correct repository:
