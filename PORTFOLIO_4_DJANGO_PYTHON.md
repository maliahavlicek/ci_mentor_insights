# OVERVIEW

This template was made as a guide to ensure you cover assessment criteria in your fourth portfolio write up. It is specific to the **PORTFOLIO 4: Full-Stack Toolkit** project. 

## Helpful tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

====================================== The Sections you Fill in are below ==============================


# PROJECT_NAME

*replace the **PROJECT NAME** header with your project's name*
- Screenshot of logo/navigation of mobile deployed site
- Include a link to deployed project with one line explanation of project


## Author
DEVELOPER_NAME


## Project Overview
- Include a picture of site that shows it in responsive states and links to deployed code: http://ami.responsivedesign.is/
- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
- Write this as a sales pitch or commercial making users want to purchase your website.
- Include a link to your deployed website


# UX
Your site is most likely geared to a certain audience, and your design choices should tie into them. Let the assessors know your thought process.

You may want to re-watch the videos about the [5 planes of UX development ](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/9c295bdc5a4048308460e262b14ab7df/) when writing up this section

### Colors

- Discuss your color pallet choices and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include a screenshot of your pallet using a tool like coolors.co

### Typography

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Images

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

### Design Elements

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you  when choosing a framework and goes hand in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

### Animations and Transitions

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've programmed 
- special hover state effects


### Custom Styles
- call out any overrides you did for bootstrap styles or the framework you used,  even if they are fonts and colors, perhaps lead assessors to the file of interest in your repo 

### Custom Javascript
- call attention to any custom javascript you created to help your User Experience you can organize this by functions or files

## Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or  hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

- You should minimally have wireframes for desktop and mobile. Adding a Tablet view will help you get into merit and distinction.


# Agile Process

## User Stories

You should be using Git Hub Issues to write your user stories.  To get to merit levels you need to show you have refined stories from Epics to Generic User stories.

[Here's the lesson](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70) on how to create a User Story Templates. 

If you want a chance at **DISTINCTION**, I'd suggest the following:
- Create an Epic Story template, this would have a title, the story and children stories
- Create a User Story template, this would initially have the title, the story, and a link to the Epic. Then you'd come back when you are prioritizing it to include the acceptance criteria, and story points, then again when you are working on it and fill in the tasks and adjust the story points if needed.
- Name your stories in a way that it's easy to tie the children to the EPICS by name.

Example: 
EPIC: Navigation
As a user, I want to have easy to see navigation on the page, so I can intuitively interact with the site without getting frustrated.

USER STORY: Navigation: Create Template
As a developer, I don't want to have copy and paste my navigation on every page. I want to use a template to house this information, so my code is easier to maintain.

USER STORY: Navigation: Desktop
As a user I want clear navigation that is up to industry standards for my desktop experience, so I can easily find what I need on a website.

USER STORY: Navigation: Mobile
As a user I want clear navigation that is up to industry standards for my mobile experience, so I can easily find what I need on a website without the navigation taking up the entire screen.

### EPIC Stories

I created epic stories for the main features and page components used on  my website.  To better manage things I prefixed my epic stories with EPIC To make my life easier I created a custom issues template for Epic Stories: ![epic user story template](documentation/images/epic_user_story.png)

You can decide if you want to have any acceptance Criteria or not for Epic stories. 

Tell the assessors where they can find your epic stories and call out the 

- Link to Epic Milestone
- link to Issues
- link to Epic Story Template

### Child Stories

After creating the epic stories or main features for my website, I created user stories that could be story pointed and tasked to help keep me feel like I was making progress, plus it shows I tried to follow the Agile Process. To manage these better I included the EPIC story name in my Title.

You can find my user stories by either looking at issues that are prefixed with USER STORY, or look at my milestone for  USER Stories.

# Information Architecture
As part of the requirements for this project you need to have at least 1 original data model.  It's this section that discusses your data and how each piece relates to another and draws out the CRUD functionality you built. 

## Entity Relationship Diagram
Wade Williams wrote a great blog about how to add a django extension to auto create an ERD. https://wadewilliams.com/technology-software/generating-erd-for-django-applications/ You can always draw one out by hand or google sheets. You can also draw this up by hand if you want or use a spreadsheet to show your data model. 

## Database Choice
Just state you used postgres as the database because the data is relational and heroku serves this up realitvely easily with no cost.

## Data Models
Show the accessors you know your data. If you end up using some data models from an example project, call that out and don't be as detailed about writing those up unless you added to them.  

Each data model that you created yourself should have its Fields, Field Type and any validation documented.  You should also cross-reference any code in your repository that relate to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE operations for these models. 

Below is an example of a write up for an Activies Data Model
### Activities Model
Activities is a table to hold a unique icon image and name values that users have associated with events and places. It helps with sorting events and prevents the need from carrying around two data objects in the larger Events and Places data structures. The purpose of an Activities object is to provide an imagery association to a category.

| DB Key 	| Data Type 	|          Purpose          	| Form Validation                        	| DB processing    	|
|--------	|:---------:	|:-------------------------:	|----------------------------------------	|------------------	|
| _id    	| ObjectId  	| unique identifier         	| None                                   	| n/a              	|
| name   	| String    	| Name of Activity          	| Required<br>Min 1 char<br>Max 50 chars 	| trim<br>to lower 	|
| icon   	| String    	| system path to image file 	| Required                               	|                  	|

Activity entries are used by events, places and filtering.

- [x] Create - An activity is potentially created when a user successfully creates a place, creates an event, updates an event, or updates a place. 
- [x] Read - The Activities table is read when a user is adding an event, updating an event, adding a place or updating a place, to determine if a new value should be created or not. The activities table is queried for using the name and icon pair, if it is found, the ObjectId is passed to the event and places. If no match is found, a new Activity is created and that ObjectID is passed to the the place or event.
- [ ] Update
- [ ] Delete
 
 This table has no deletion or updates associated with it. It's strictly create and read. Eventually, maintenance scripts should be written to delete unused/deprecated entries.

The reading/writing of the activities table is housed in the [what2do2day/activities/views.py](what2do2day/activities/views.py) file.

### CRUD Diagrams
This is if you want to go for distinction.  You can also have CRUD diagrams to show them visually how the model is used in your site. 

I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and hooked it up to my google drive to create the screenshot below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/154406188-c9beb57a-2fd1-4f26-a8ed-bee320e46e3d.png)


# Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so and how they tie into  your user stories.

## Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, and each page/layer of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, **include a screenshot of the implemented feature** and **at least 2 bullet points of their importance**.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

## Future Features

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.

# Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) NOTE: You may need to view the source of each page and paste that into the validator
- [JS validation](https://jshint.com) for each .js file/ , if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `
- [JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/) for each .json file 
- [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/) include a screenshot of results. (you should do this for all .py files in your repo, or note that there are no red errors in gitpod after the file is saved)

## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

## Manual Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 

At this point you really should be using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it helps you with the AGILE process requirement.

Create Custom Issue Template and a milestone in git hub.[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing) I put together on how to do this.

## Automated Testing
If you managed to write jasmine tests or some django tests, note those files out here and how to run them.  I only did this in my last project as I didn't have the time or energy to learn how to write tests. https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/documentation/TESTING.md is my write up about those and how I ran them, but a simple test I'd recommend is authentication and any views you limit to superusers or logged in users

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/challenges/tests/test_views.py 
## Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Lighthouse Audits

You should run your deployed website pages through lighthouse's audit to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO scores. You should aim to get 85 or higher score. 
https://web.dev/measure/  If you have lower scores, read the report and follow the links to address the flagged issues. You can run this tool from Chrome Dev Tools too against your local machine, but the performance will the worst (I personally ignore my performance results unless it's deployed code. I hope for > 60 on that mark, but > 85 on the other 3)



# Deployment

## Requirements
If the user is required to have certain keys and credentials you should include this section with diretions on how to get the necessary information.
ex)
1. **Google Account:** In order to have verification and forgot password emails sent to registered users you need a google account. If you don't have one  [Create a google account](https://accounts.google.com/Signup)
2. **Google APIs**
    1. in a new incognito tab, log into your new google account.
    1. then update the url to be: https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?pli=1 
        
        **GOOGLE DRIVE API Access**
        1.  create a new project for this, call it XXXXXX (You might want to refer to what you see in this video: https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/071036790a5642f9a6f004f9888b6a45/ at the bottom of the screen to write out steps.)
        2. Then click on Add APIs and Services and select Libraries
        3. Search for Google Drive
        4. Click Enable
        5. Click Create Credentials
        6. Select Google Drive API from the drop down, Application Data, then no and click the Next Button
        7.  (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api) 
        8. for service account details fill in a service account name ex) xxx_API, then click Create and Continue
        9. For the Accoun acces, select Role: Basic/Editor then continue
        10. Then Click Done
        11. Now select the newly created service account
        12. Click on the KEYS Tab
        13. Click Add Key
        14. Select JSON type (right click to show in folder so you know where the file was saved.
        
        **GOOGLE SHEETS API Access**
        You may need to us the back button get to the APIS & SErvices section from where you were.
        1. click the Libray  Tab and serarch for Google Sheets
        2. click enable

3. The downloaded credentialsJSON file is basically your creds.json file that you need to put into your heroku settings or gitpod environment to access your google drive.

4. Google Sheet Template
  - If you had to create specific sheets for your project, instruct users to make their own copy of it from yours and rename it back to what the python project expects
  - And don't forget to share the spreadsheet in question with the client_email from the creds.json 
## Gitpod
This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace and what goes in the env.py file without REAL KEYS.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_email": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accoutns.google.com/0/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cer_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Heroku
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to Heroku. Include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

You may want to re-watch the lessons when writing up this section.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values.
Do not share your personal keys but either cut them out of the screen shot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such values.

## Fork the repository
Instruct users to make a fork so they have a copy of the repository in THEIR own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03

#### New Project
Log into Heroku and create a new project. Name it something like XXX_coders_bistro.


#### Settings
On the settings tab you have to address two things:
1. **Config Vars**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135869-215d2e0f-805d-40a8-a8c2-fb1098e2645d.png)

  At a bar minimum you should show the user that they need to add the PORT. 8000 key value pair.


2. **Build Packs**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135918-28cac112-7766-4277-905c-4a4963d8442d.png)

  add Python Then Node.js


#### Deploy
1. Set up to github and select the correct repository:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132136113-c257c921-d10c-4ccc-af09-6a1d25136395.png)

2. Deploy either manual or automatic
