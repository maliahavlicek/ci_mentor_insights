# OVERVIEW

This template was made as a guide to ensure you cover assessment criteria in your second milestone write up. It is specific to the **INTERACTIVE FRONT-END MILESTONE** project.

## Helpful tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.


# PROJECT NAME
*replace the **PROJECT NAME** header with your project's name*
- Screenshot of logo/navigation of mobile deployed site
- Include a link to deployed project with one line explanation of project

## Author
DEVELOPER_NAME

## Project Overview
- Include a picture of site that shows it in responsive states and links to deployed code: http://ami.responsivedesign.is/
- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
- Write this as a sales pitch or commercial to entice users to interact with your site or how you want investors to purchase your website.
- Include a link to your deployed website

## UX

### Project Goals
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. Do age groups, gender, or hobbies play a role in the demographics of whom this site is for?

#### User Goals

Write goals form the perspective of each user group of your website. Common types of users are:
> - new users
> - existing users
> - people looking for vacations
> - people wanting to play a game

#### Developer Goals

List out the goals as a developer you hope to achieve by making this website. 

#### Website Owner Goals

List out any goals a website owner would have for this website. You may not develop them, but investors would want to know how they could make money.

### User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Design Choices
Your site is most likely geared to a certain audience, and your design choices should tie into them. Let the assessors know your thought process.

You may want to re-watch the videos about the [5 planes of UX development ](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/9c295bdc5a4048308460e262b14ab7df/) when writing up this section

#### Colors

- Discuss your color pallet choices and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include a screenshot of your pallet using a tool like coolors.co

#### Typography

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

#### Images

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

#### Design Elements

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you  when choosing a framework and goes hand in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

> - top menu (desktop navigation)
> - sidebar menu (mobile navigation)
> - footer
> - containers/cards
> - buttons
> - text input
> - textarea inputs
> - dropdowns
> - modals/layers
> - check boxes
> - switches
> - accordions
> - pagination
> - datepickers
> - maps
> - images
> - tooltips
> - icons
> - volume control
> - contact form

#### Animations and Transitions

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've included 
- special hover state effects

#### Custom Javascript
- call attention to any custom javascript you created to help your User Experience you can organize this by functions or files

### Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

#### Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, layer, and each page of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

#### Future Features

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- If you included a js file that isn't your own, add it here.

- If you included a css file that isn't your own, add it here.

- Common 3rd party technologies to list:
  - wirefames
  - favicons
  - color palette images
  - fonts
  - CSS Frameworks
  - markdown tables
  - markdown table of contents
  
Please note, if this gets more than 5 items, you may want to break it down into logical subsections

### Programing Languages
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) The project uses **CSS** to define DOM appearance. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) The project uses **HTML** to define DOM elements.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) Documentation within the readme was generated using markdown

### Frameworks and Extensions
- [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) Rather than re-invent many things, I chose to customize the look and feel of bootstrap 4.0 
- [google sheets & drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mYY4M0jXf6sPWesmP9Q-wFvjpgT1v8IU?usp=sharing) - Used to create testing documents and project plan (feature to do list) 

### Fonts
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free) - for icons associated with buttons and inputs
- [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC) - Google Font's Patrick Hand font was used for headers and home page dialog
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) - Google's Raleway font was used as the main font

### Tools
- [github](https://github.com/) - used for version control of project files and branching out to try different things without adversely affecting a functional set of code
- [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - used to create professional looking wire frames.
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [colors.co](https://coolors.co/) I used a colors.co's color pallet tool to help pick complementary colors.

### APIs
- [SMTP](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/smtplib.py) - Send emails to users 
- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/) - Customized Mapping Widgets


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

### Automated Testing
Whenever it is feasible, automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

If you did not run automating testing. State why you chose not to.

### Manual Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    
Here is a [Manual Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189VpSeEG9oevSRhvb2WZl8zCk9L3s2iWQyrJ_1jjAGQ/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use as a starting point to keep track of your testing efforts. Make a copy of it in your own account and update as needed to reflect the browsers you are testing and features.  

It's ok to spot check specific functionality across devices and browsers but each page should be viewed as a whole for each device/browser combo at least once.

A quick way to check if items are exceeding the screen width of a project is to run this javascript in the console for various screen emulations:

```
var docWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),function(el){if(el.offsetWidth > docWidth){console.log(el);}});
```

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 


### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any.

Remember to use proper markdown for commands and enumerated steps.

### Deploy Locally

Write out the steps you take starting from cloning the repository in github or clicking a gitpod button to run your code locally. Test it out and make sure it works. This can be running from your IDE of choice like VSCode or PyCharm or GitPod.

You may want to re-watch the [initial deployment in gitpod video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/dcd449bd41a446f49df3268f91dd06fc/072c95175f1148438de9d82e7a756ee1/?child=first) when writing up this section.

### Deploy To GitHub Pages

Write out steps you would take and test them to deploy your code to GitHub Pages.

## Credits

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did. 

### Content

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site

### Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

### Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
